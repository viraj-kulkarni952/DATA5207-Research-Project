# DATA5207-Research-Project
This is my Research Project undergone for the subject *DATA5207 - Data Analysis in the Social Sciences* at the University of Sydney in 2023. This was created using R Markdown for planning and answering the question of "What explains domestic violence rates in NSW local government areas? Use a combination of the data sources provided, to establish a theory of ecological crime rates and an explanatory model."

This repository includes the research plan, listing the manner in what data will be used, why it will be used, and how the data will be analysed to answering the question.

The repository also includes the research project which is the actual execution of R code and discussion of the results outputted from the analysis to help answer the question in focus.
